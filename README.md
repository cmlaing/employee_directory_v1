 <h1>Treehouse Unit 8 Project - Employee Directory</h1>

 <p><i>Project description(from Treehouse):</i></p>

 <p>
 Awesome Startup is a distributed company with employees working all over the world. They need a smart way to for employees to share contact information with each other. In this project, you’ll use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory. You’ll request a JSON object from the API using fetch and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
